    "## Intervention Date and Optimal Lockdown Severity\n",
    "\n",
    "This intention of this notebook is to explore the notion that, during a pandemic, the harder the lockdown the better. It uses far too many simplifying assumptions to have implications for policy, but is an interesting exercise nonetheless. The engine used is the [SIR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model).\n",
    "\n",
    "More explicitly, the goal of this notebook is to establish how the SIR model suggests that optimal severity of a lockdown changes with how soon a lockdown takes place following initial infection.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was inspired by a preamble from one of my Macroeconomics problem sets question, as given below...\n",

    "We will only consider health consequences and ignore discounting. This means that the damage of the pandemic is the limiting value of $R_t$.\n",

    "The premise of the question was that we were to compare the efficacy of two 25-day lockdowns starting on day 31, one where the infection rate $\\beta$ is reduced by half for the duration (partial lockdown), and another where $\\beta = 0$ for the duration (full lockdown).\n",

    "### Assumption Tweaks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feasibility of a Full Lockdown\n",
    "\n",
    "I assume that eliminating transmission completely is unfeasible, and only study cases where lockdown can reduce transmission by up to 99%.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feasibility of Elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we use a unit measure of people in the above model, the infection rate may *tend* to zero, but will never reach it; the virus is never truly eliminated. This ignores a clear integer constraint - there is a countable number of people on earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "I consider a country with 100 million people, and as such if for some $t$ we have...\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I_t \\leq 0.5 \\cdot 10^{-8}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "...I overide the model and let $I_t = 0$, such that the virus has been eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "In the model as given, $1/\\mathbb{T} = 1/7$ infected people will \"recover\" (get better or die) each period.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, it does hold that the mean length of infection for each person is 7 days. However, if 100,000 people are infected in period 0, then 1,335 of those will still be infected in period 28, and 18 will still be infected in period 56.\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems untenably unrealistic. Instead, I assume that for each person infected, the duration of their infection is distributed according to...\n",

    "Duration - 1 \\sim \\text{Poisson}(6)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This preserves our mean duration length of 7 (and indeed our calculation of $\\beta$, for which the mean length of duration is the only relevant moment). However, it substantially increases the impact of a 25-day change in the value of $\\beta$ on the proportion of people infected.  "
